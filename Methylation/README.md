# DNA Methylation Profiling

## Purpose
DNA Methylation is a method to see which genes are experssed in patients that aren't typically expressed in Normal patients, traits which could then be linked to the disease. We look for statistical significance of expression.

## Problems
The files were stored in a proprietary format, one that could only be opened and analyzed in R - a programming language that I don't know. 

## Files
[Test1.ipynb](Test1.ipynb) First attempt at using Pandas to extract the data from the CSV metadata file.
