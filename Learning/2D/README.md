# 2-Dimensional Categorization

The 2-Dimensional classification involved slicing the MRI images into 2 dimensional images, and then running image classification algorithms to classify each brain slide. Obviously, this is very biologically unsound, 

## Problems

### Modularity

Many of the images are of different sizes and shapes. Currentely the traditional image processing techniques require images to be reshaped to a specific shape, but you lots alot of data. **Solved using GlobalAveraging Layers**
