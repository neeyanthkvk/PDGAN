# Using GANs to Automatically Generate "Medical Images" for Data Augmentation

## Purpose
Currently my dataset has 614 subjects, with approximately 10 Million dimensions. I hoped to augment this with generated images that had similar structures that could hopefully increase the classification accuracy. Potentially we could also use how the machine generates it into extraploating what it believes are the "traits" of a MRI scan of a patient that has Parkinsons' Disease.
